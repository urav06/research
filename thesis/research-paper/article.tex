\section{Related Work}\label{sec2}

The evolution of time series classification has been characterized by the emergence of diverse algorithmic paradigms, each capturing different aspects of temporal patterns \cite{tsc-bakeoff}. This diversity has led to the development of comprehensive ensemble methods that achieve state-of-the-art accuracy through paradigm combination, albeit with significant computational overhead \cite{hive-cote-2}. In this section, we examine the theoretical foundations underlying successful ensemble approaches and identify opportunities for targeted algorithmic complementarity that balance accuracy with computational efficiency.

\subsection{The Paradigm Diversity Principle in Time Series Classification}

The comprehensive evaluation by \citet[p.~637]{tsc-bakeoff} established a fundamental principle in TSC: ``no one representation will dominate'' across the diverse range of problem types encountered in practice. This seminal work evaluated 18 algorithms across 85 datasets using rigorous statistical protocols, revealing that different algorithmic paradigms excel on different problem characteristics. Specifically, the authors demonstrated that performance differences between optimal and suboptimal paradigms can range from 5-15\%, highlighting the substantial gains achievable through intelligent paradigm combination.

The success of the first comprehensive ensemble, COTE (Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles), provided empirical validation of this principle \citep[p.~638]{tsc-bakeoff}. By combining four distinct transformation domains—shapelet, dictionary, interval, and spectral—COTE achieved an 8\% improvement over the then-dominant Dynamic Time Warping approach. However, this accuracy gain came at considerable computational cost, with complexity scaling as $O(n^2m^4)$, primarily driven by the computationally expensive shapelet transform component.

\subsection{The Convolutional Kernel Revolution}

A paradigm shift occurred with the introduction of ROCKET \citep[p.~1455]{rocket}, which demonstrated that ``simple linear classifiers using random convolutional kernels achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with a fraction of the computational expense of existing methods.'' This breakthrough challenged the prevailing assumption that computational complexity was necessary for high accuracy in TSC.

ROCKET's innovation centered on the insight that ``a large number of random convolutional kernels which, in combination, capture features relevant for time series classification'' could rival learned features while maintaining linear scalability \citep[p.~1455]{rocket}. The algorithm's novel Proportion of Positive Values (PPV) pooling mechanism proved particularly effective, capturing not just the presence but the prevalence of patterns across time series \cite{rocket}. The empirical results were striking: training on all 85 UCR datasets required less than 2 hours compared to days for existing methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy with HIVE-COTE.

This foundation enabled subsequent innovations in the ROCKET family. MiniRocket \cite{minirocket} achieved near-deterministic performance with even greater speed, while MultiRocket \cite{multirocket} extended the approach to capture additional temporal relationships through multiple pooling operators and transformations.

\subsection{Targeted Algorithmic Complementarity}

Building on ROCKET's computational efficiency principles, recent work has explored targeted combinations of specific algorithms designed for complementary information capture. \citet[p.~1780]{hydra} introduced Hydra, which bridges dictionary and convolutional approaches through ``competing convolutional kernels'' that organize random kernels into groups where only the closest pattern match contributes to the feature representation. This approach combines the computational efficiency of random kernels with the interpretability advantages of dictionary methods.

Simultaneously, \citet{quant} developed Quant, a minimalist interval-based method that captures discriminative information through quantile distributions across fixed dyadic intervals. Quant's theoretical foundation rests on the principle that ``class can be distinguished based on the distribution of values in different locations of a time series,'' providing a complementary perspective to pattern-based approaches. Remarkably, Quant achieves state-of-the-art accuracy using only quantile features and fixed intervals, with total compute time of less than 15 minutes across 142 UCR datasets.

\subsection{The Computational Challenge of Comprehensive Ensembles}

While HIVE-COTE 2.0 \cite{hive-cote-2} represents the current accuracy benchmark in TSC through its hierarchical combination of five algorithmic domains, its computational requirements remain prohibitive for many practical applications. The ensemble requires 340+ hours for complete training across the UCR archive, with individual components like the Shapelet Transform consuming hours even with contracted training \citep[p.~3218]{hive-cote-2}. This computational expense stems from the exhaustive coverage approach: including all major TSC paradigms and allowing the meta-learning framework to determine optimal weightings.

Despite contractable training options that achieve 98\% of full accuracy in 4 hours and 99\% in 12 hours \cite{hive-cote-2}, the fundamental tension between comprehensive coverage and computational efficiency remains unresolved. This creates an opportunity for targeted ensemble approaches that achieve comparable accuracy through strategic algorithm selection rather than exhaustive paradigm coverage.
