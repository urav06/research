# Time Series Classification Research

Research repository for developing competitive TSC algorithms. Currently exploring combinations of Quant and Hydra algorithms.

## Structure

- `quant/`, `hydra/`, `aaltd2024/` - Algorithm implementations (submodules)
- `tsckit/` - Python package for unified algorithm/dataset interfaces
- `*.ipynb` - Experiment notebooks
- `papers/` - Reference papers

## Goal

Build a new time series classification algorithm that competes with state-of-the-art methods. Current focus is on ensemble approaches combining different feature extraction strategies.
